This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route attempts to parse the `id` parameter as an integer without checking for potential errors like non-numeric input. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution provides robust error handling to address this issue.
